  					I am currently a student at the University of California, Irvine where I'm in the process of pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Informatics. 
  					My specialization emphasizes Information Systems where I learned from courses such as database management and information retrieval. Additionally, I have taken courses in 
  					front end user interface design. These combination of classes have allowed me to take interest in Web Development at both the front and back end. I am also interested in 
  					the development of software and computer information systems. 

  					<br><br><br>
  					Aside from school I find thrill in working on web applications, programming different langauges and learning their conceptual differences. I also enjoy finding ways of how
  					technology can make the other activites I enjoy easier. Since I am always looking for ways to make exercising more efficient, I am interested in creating a technology that can 
  					help do so.   

  					<br><br><br>
 					Aside from anything tech related, I am interested in sports such as football and basketball, working out, hiking, going to the beach, traveling and eating. I have moved around alot 
 					being born in Chicago, living in Texas, and now residing in California. Being from Chicago, I am an avid fan of the city and its teams the Bears and the Bulls!

	  <!-- 					My name is Muzamil Syed. I was born in Chicago, IL where I spent the first 3 years of my life before moving to Texas and spending the next 10 years of my childhood. 
  					It was within these years where I developed an ambitious interest in computers. I received my first computer in fourth grade. Even though this computer did not 
  					match the capacity of computers today, I was amazed at what tasks it can accomplish and knew that someday I would be a part of its advancements. 
  					 Up until now I have been satisfying my curiousity about technology by downloading and comparing software functionalities, creating webpages, and learning the hardware components of a computer's interior.
