  					I am currently a student at the University of California, Irvine where I'm in the process of pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Informatics. 
  					My specialization emphasizes Information Systems where I learned from courses such as database management and information retrieval. Additionally, I have taken courses in 
  					front end user interface design. These combination of classes have allowed my to take interest in Web Development at both the front and back end. I am also interested in 
  					the development of software and computer information systems.

  <!-- 					My name is Muzamil Syed. I was born in Chicago, IL where I spent the first 3 years of my life before moving to Texas and spending the next 10 years of my childhood. 
  					It was within these years where I developed an ambitious interest in computers. I received my first computer in fourth grade. Even though this computer did not 
  					match the capacity of computers today, I was amazed at what tasks it can accomplish and knew that someday I would be a part of its advancements. 
  					 Up until now I have been satisfying my curiousity about technology by downloading and comparing software functionalities, creating webpages, and learning the hardware components of a computer's interior.

 					In my free time I enjoy playing sports such as football/basketball, working out, hiking, going to the beach, and eating.
